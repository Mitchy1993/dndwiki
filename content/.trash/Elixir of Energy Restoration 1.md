A glass flask with an oddly colored sweet tasting liquid inside.

This elixir, when drank, will remove all levels of [exhaustion](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Exhaustion "5e SRD:Conditions") the creature has for two hours. However, two hours after drinking the potion, all levels of [exhaustion](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Exhaustion "5e SRD:Conditions") return, and the creature must make a DC 12 [Constitution](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Constitution "5e SRD:Constitution") saving throw or their [exhaustion](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Exhaustion "5e SRD:Conditions") level is increased by 1.

If one consumes this elixir more than once in eight hours, they must make a DC 17 [Wisdom](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Wisdom "5e SRD:Wisdom") saving throw or become dependent on the elixir. A creature who has become dependent on them can no longer go below one level of [exhaustion](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Exhaustion "5e SRD:Conditions") without the aid of either this elixir or the [coffee](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Coffee_(5e_Equipment) "Coffee (5e Equipment)") item, and the DCs for the saving throws of this item increases by 3 while dependent on it. Dependency on the elixir lasts for two weeks, and failing the [Wisdom](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Wisdom "5e SRD:Wisdom") saving throw to become dependent on this item does not increase the item's saving throw DCs, it only resets the time remaining until the dependency wears off.
