Dom has been tipped off that there is a safe haven for his kind in Waterdeep somewhere and that he needs to meet up with a woman who will give him directions once he's in the city

#### ***Fate of the Weave (Sabel)***

It was done... the months of punishment to mind and body had come to an end. With the initiation ritual completed, Sable rose to his feet, lycanthropic power coursing through his veins for the first time. Head Master [[Lyra Dawnfury]] stepped forward, her gaze steady and piercing.

"Sable," she began, her voice thick with authority, "with this newfound strength, comes great responsibility. There are two tasks I must entrust to you, tasks that will shape the course of your life."

Sable listened, his focus heightened by his primal senses.

"First," Lyra continued, "there are whispers of a safe haven for "hunted races" in Waterdeep. If this is true, they would undoubtedly be a prime target for the Society. 

Take this sending stone," she said, placing a small, rune-carved stone in his hand. "Deliver it to them to the haven. If they are attacked, we will know. The haven will undoubtedly be lost, but we will have our first lead on the Society in months"

Sable nodded, understanding the importance of the mission.

"Secondly," Lyra continued, her voice lowering to a grave tone, "there is a Cleric in Waterdeep who offers a Boon of Mystra to those who will aid her in an upcoming mission. This boon could grant us the power to locate the heart of the Society and strike it down once and for all. Involved yourself in her mission by any means possible, and obtain the boon at all costs.

To assist you with your task, the Order is providing you with a lease on one of our vault treasures."

Lyra gestures and her acolytes lay out an arrangment of choices in front of Sable(you)

***Choose 1 uncommon magic item***
"yoyoyo" Sable replies

A look of confusion spreads over Lyras face... After a moment of pause, Lyra gestures to her acolytes who rummage through the vault for a moment before producing a small circular object

"To be honest, it's been centuries since someone requested this item but.. here you are"

Lyra hands the circular object to Sable

**Moonshadow Spinner:**
- This seemingly ordinary wooden yoyo has a smooth, polished surface adorned with intricate carvings of moon phases.
- When activated by the user, the Moonshadow Spinner emits a soft, silvery glow reminiscent of moonlight.
- As the user spins the yoyo, the glow intensifies, casting dim light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
- Once per long rest, the user can channel their lycanthropic energy into the Moonshadow Spinner, causing it to transform into a spectral wolf-like creature for 1 minute. During this time, the spectral wolf can move independently and attack enemies within 30 feet, dealing 1d6 force damage with each hit.
- Additionally, the Moonshadow Spinner grants its wielder advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made at night or in areas with low light conditions.
