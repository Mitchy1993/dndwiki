#### Opening
Abandoned by his crew at Waterdeep a month ago he's drinking away his misery and failure

His old crew comes down the stairs having finished their drinks upstairs, by [[Alenia]] who sets in:
	"right where we left ya, the worst pirate I ever seen"
- Get's confused during raids and punches our own men
- Falls asleep or gets hungry during his turn on watch
- I say to swab the deck, you start swapping positions with random crew members causing freaking chaos
- OH and my personal favorite I told you the other day to "batten down the hatches" and some how you understood that to mean "finding wooden bat you can and HURL it down the hatches eventually striking the first mate in the bloody head"

MY GODS you are the dumbest person I have ever met and your finished on this crew. 

CHUGS ALE and slams

the rest of you back at the ship in 30, or were leaving you with I'm

Remaining pirates pick a fight
- Remember that time we gave him an old carriage wheel and to him he was steering the ship?
- Remember the time we gave him a gold coin and told him it was fancy yellow chocolate!
- Remember when he started crying because Captain said fire the cannons?... He thought he they were losing their jobs
You absolute mook!

Mystra's acolyte sees him defeat them all and requests his help offering him anything he could desire.

Connors Goblin hears this and boasts about how skilled an adventurer he is and acolyte hesitantly welcomes him along too

Sends him to fetch a carriage for their journey from the stable and meet back at the temple at some point
Friend of [[Turak]]
