As the big glowing cheese wheel in the sky starts creepin' up, you find yourself trudgin' through these cit(_Feel free to fully expand or fully rewrite these reflections, it should help us stay aligned in how we believe Sando might be feeling at the end of each adventure._)y streets, your legs are like rockets or somethin'. Up ahead, at the horse hangout, there's this huge chunk of cash just waitin' for ya. It's like, the biggest stack of coin you've laid eyes on in forever.

And there's this breeze, from the big ol' pool of water nearby, smacking you in the face. You start thinkin' 'bout the time you spent with these new folks you met. Takes you back. Back to when you were just a whelp, runnin' around with the herd, before life got all tangled up in your brain. Used to be simple.. Used to feel like you fit in somewhere...

But why you gotta go thinkin' 'bout that now? Snap outta it!

You shake your head, clutching tighter the rat loot and focusin' on the horse palace up ahead. All those thoughts drift off like leaves in the wind.

#### Sando
As the moon begins its ascent into the evening-night sky, you trudge back to the Yawning Portal alongside your new acquaintances. Despite the setbacks earlier tonight, a coy smile threatens to pierce through your well-maintained ruse. Ah, you would have relished the opportunity to engage in a bit of mischief, perhaps breaking into carriages, but alas, that plan did not come to fruition. However, fate has a way of weaving its own tapestry, and it seems you've stumbled upon the very individual you've been seeking.

This elf wizard, Rovair, is a suspicious one, and you'll need to handle this situation with care. But oh, the thrill of it all! In just one day within this city, you've managed to infiltrate his inner circle. Soon enough, this suffocating vessel you find yourself trapped in will be transformed into a mighty tower, the height you've longed for is close at hand!

As the party draws closer to the tavern, a smirk finally breaks through your facade. It's only a matter of time now, dear Rovair. Only a matter of time...

#### Grizz
As the moon climbs up high, you and yer new pals scurry back to the Yawning Portal, you pat your shellfone thoughtfully. It's been a good bit since Boss had a reason to proud of an update, and tonight's a real winner.

Ya sneak a peek at yer crew, a real mixed bag of adventurers pulled together by luck, fate or some such. Dey a weird bunch, but dey ain't half bad in a scrap. Long as dey keep ya breathin' and don't get too grabby with da loot, ya reckon you'll get along alright.

Da rat business has already given ya more "road money" than ya usually carry during a loot run, with dis good of a start, ya reckon you'll soon have da shop swimmin' in gold.

Da **real** joy's thinkin' 'bout da look on Griffin Burnshot's mug when he sees what ya brought back. Dat smug oaf from "Kill Em Goodes" thinks he's got da market sewn up tight. Ha! Little does he know, yous gonna have stuff in yer bag dat'd make his eyes pop out.

Ya can feel it in yer goblin bones, dis is da big one. Da kinda score dat'll have folks singin' yer praises from here to da Underdark. And ain't nobody gonna stand in da way of you claimin' yer spot at da top.

#### Rovair
As the moon casts its glow over Waterdeep, you tread the familiar streets, accompanied by newfound allies, mulling over the day's revelations. The toil and sweat poured into rebuilding your magical repertoire finally bears fruit; for the first time since *that night*, you have objective evidence that you haven't lost your edge completely.

Months of meticulous spell reconstruction, adjusting pronunciations, gestures, and ingredients, are now yielding signs of progress. While full recovery remains a distant goal, a glimmer of hope emerges from the shadows.

Varaj's counsel has proven invaluable once more; allying with these adventurers is proving beneficial amidst your struggles. As for Sando's plea for aid, it is worth considering, however, at present its urgency fades against the weightier task before you.

 Of greater pertinence is the enigmatic transformation of the Kenku in the recent skirmish. He trails behind you now veiled beneath a cloak of unassuming normalcy. Assessing his threat level may be wise before commiting to any enduring relationship.

And finally, there is the strange arcane energy you found in the depths of the Rat King's lair. For all of your studying and experience, you are baffled by this magic that is both strange and yet... familiar.

With a variety of thoughts swirling, the familiar sight of the Yawning Portal looms ahead. Your mind shifts gears, preparing for the nightly ritual of arcane study and spell preparations.

#### Sable
As the moon climbs over Waterdeep, you stride alongside your newfound "bodyguards." Despite their foolish decision to charge headlong into danger, there's a sense of security in their combined abilities when danger looms. Memories of the grueling Blood Hunter training flood your mind, and after the last battle you're grateful for it. The Order demanded that you embark on a dangerous mission, and several times you nearly decided to screw The Order and run away but now... with these allies, survival feels attainable.

Abandoning the mission and this group is still an option, but the thought of facing the Purification Order alone weighs heavily on you. Do you dare brave the unknown or cling to the safety of your companions? The Yawning Portal looms closer, offering both refuge and uncertainty. Another day survived, another step toward evading your relentless pursuers. But is this brief tranquility a promise of freedom or the calm before the storm?
