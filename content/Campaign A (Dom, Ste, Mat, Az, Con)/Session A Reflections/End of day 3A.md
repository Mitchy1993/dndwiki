Reflections
(_Feel free to fully expand or fully rewrite these reflections, it should help us stay aligned in how we believe **Character** might be feeling at the end of each adventure._)

#### Gruumshar

#### Sando

*Over the past few days there have been moments, never more than instantaneous blips in time, but you swear that darkness swirls around you and the voice of a woman calls to you*

*It happened as you turned 3 unsuspecting cultists into mulch in a cloud of daggers, it happened yesterday at the tavern as you sent pulses of black inky energy through the body of a giant rat, and it happened again today as you inspected the lonely corpse of the poor elven woman hanging on the third floor of the Yawning Portal*

*Each time there is a subtle pull, almost as if something is reaching out to you in those moments.*

**How does Sando feel about these occurences?**

- *Scared*
- *Curious*
- *Excited*

**Will Sando seek out this woman's call or try to surpress it?** 

- *Surpress, describe him trying to surpress*
- *Seek, describe what he thinks he needs to do to draw her out*

*As Sando watches the carnage in the ring, how does Sando reflect on what Gruumshar's fearsome strength means for his plans*

#### Grizz

*As the fight's come to a close you look down and realize your fists are so tightly clenched that your sharp goblin nails are diggin into your own hands leaving little tiny cuts on the palms.*

*Recreation like this was common back home, but your life is different now.... YOU are different now.... or at least that's what Boss believes. And you believe it too, it's just that every now and then there is night a like this where the primal taste for barbaric traditions are whetted.*

*As the party begins to head back to the Tavern the shell phone rings, right on cue*...
