If they don't kidnap Grizz then they kidnap grock

Connor's character and his brother escaped a life of crime, but not without consequence. Their Goblin tribe continues their criminal raiding activities. And at some point happens upon the adventuring party. 

Usually they're aim is to rob, loot, and possibly capture travelers to be sold as slaves. 

But when they see Connor they will all attempt to catch him with nets and then use an action to attach net to horses

5 melee
4 archers

If they catch him, or if they want to find goblin camp go to [[Goblin Camps]]
