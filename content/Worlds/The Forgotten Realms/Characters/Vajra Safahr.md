**Vajra Safahr** as the seventh [[Blackstaff]] was killed. She was quite young when she became the Blackstaff, and was the youngest Blackstaff in Waterdeep's history.

The Blackstaff she carried when proclaiming her status as the new Blackstaff was the "true blackstaff", a large rune-inscribed duskwood staff with silver veins. 

The whole staff was blackened by use. Atop the staff was a large axe head in the shape of snarling wolf head, which had glowing green eyes.
