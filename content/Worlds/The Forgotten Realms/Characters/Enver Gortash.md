Previously a counsler in [[Baldur's Gate]] and chosen of [[Bane]] who stole the Crown of Karsus from [[Mephistopheles]].

Gortash used the Crown as the dominiate the Sword Coast through a brilliant proxy mind control scheme.

By removing the "Nether Stones" from the Crown of Karsus and dividing them between himself, [[Orin the Red]] and General [[Ketheric Thorm]] he was able to mind control an Elder Brain. Using the Elder Brain he began infecting people with Illithid tadpoles, super charged by the Brain wearing the Crown of Karsus. Instead of undergoing [[ceremorphosis]] Gortash was able to instruct the Brain to halt the process very early on so that virtualy only the hive mind part of the processes completed on the infected. This meant Goratash could infect and puppeteer all whom he wished so long as he and his accomplices maintained control of the "Nether Stones"

Gortash was ultimately defeated by [[Tav]], and the efforts of the Tav's allies
