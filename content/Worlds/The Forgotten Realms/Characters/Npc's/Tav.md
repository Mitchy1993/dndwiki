Tav, or "The Tav," as they came to be known was a shapeshifting being from largely unknown origin'. Reports on it's age, background, abilities and even appearance ranged wildly to the degree that contemporary historian's can only gather that Tav had the cosmic ability to appear to each person in a way that appealed to them most.

While the specifics of the Tav's nature are impossible to corroborate, it is universally agreed upon that Tav led a group of adventure's to Baldur's Gate in order to defeat [[Enver Gortash]], [[Orin the Red]], and [[Ketheric Thorm]] who had dominated an Elder Brain using the [[Crown of Karsus]]. 

Many fought along side this hero in the final battle for [[Baldur's Gate]], the [[Sword Coast]], and quite possibly [[Toril]] itself, but when the cries of battle quieted and the Elder Brain lay in the harbor the Tav was nowhere to be found.

Some say that he was killed fighting the Brain, other's say that he became a [[Mind Flayer]] and nobly took his own life to protect others, and still others say that he willingly plunged into Avernus to fight in the Blood War for reasons that were his own.
