Gang leader of [[Pathogen]]

Want's to spread his gang to all corners of Faerun

##### Story
- "Back when I was a boy in school, the alchemy professor called me up to the front of the class. She grabbed my wrist and cast a spell... next them we know the room is bathed blood red... and bubbles of all different kinds everywhere"
	- She said 'You see this bubble right here Vendrich, this is bacteria it is bad and it is inside you,' but what's interesting is that it also keeps you safe. 
		- These little guys staying busy means your bacteria fighters, your immune system stays in shape
	- What do you think would happen then without all this every day bacteria? Surely our immune systems would get lazy! & with a lazy immune system every one of us would be killed by the first infection that decided to spring up.
	- So remember *& she looked at me...* sometimes "bad" is simply problem of perspective
- This city needs us... 
- And I wanna bring our services to all of Faerun
