[[Triton]] leader of the [[Order of Tye]]... He thinks *everything* is a trap

Admirius Ackbar left the [[Elemental Planes]](Water) in a attempt to "seek his destiny"
<small>(in reality he just got made fun of because he looked nothing like a normal triton,  his eyes were all screwed up. Eventually he couldn't take it and decided to start fresh somewhere else)<big>

By complete chance Ackbar saved [[Lord Peneshay]] from drowning during a conflict off the dock of [[Waterdeep]]. They became close friends, and ultimately, Peneshay made Ackbar his right hand man and successor to the Order.
