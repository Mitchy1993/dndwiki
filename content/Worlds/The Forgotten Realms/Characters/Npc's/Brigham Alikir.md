# Circle of Shadow's Druid
Circle of Shadows

Those in this circle live where the canopy is thick. The crossroads where travlers lose their way in the forest and jungles. They see it as their sacred duty to be the necessary evil. Not a darkness born of necromancy or the nine hells but the cruel hand of nature herself.

**2nd Level**

Bonus Cantrip

Upon joining this Circle you learn your the _Minor illusion_ or _Chill Touch_ Cantrip.

_This is the optional ability, simply to get the theme across, though I’m happy to remove it_

Strength of the Shadows

Your familiarity with the shadows and dark places has caused you to become resistant to necrotic damage, in addition you gain darkvision to 60ft, if you already have darkvision its range is instead increased by 30ft.

_I find this Thematic, and reasonably strong, though I’m keen to hear your thoughts_

Shadow Form

When you join this Circle at second level you learn the art of becoming a shadow. You may expend one use of your wild shape to become a _Shadow_ (MM.269) with the following changes.

- the _Strength Drain_ Attack is replaced with the following attack. **Life Drain.** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage. On a hit your shadow form regains a number of hitpoints equal to half the damage dealt.
    
- it gains a number of additional hit die equal to half your Druid level rounded down.
    

The same rules apply as your regular Beast shapes and once you’ve used this ability, you cannot do so again until you’ve finished a long or short rest. At 10th level you may use your wildshape to assume this form as often as you wish.

_before you panic, CR wise this is weaker than a moon druid, that said I know the potency of Shadows so until 10th level it’s limited to once per short rest, and from then till 20th it’s twice, in addition this form has a low AC and quite low health so I think it’s reasonable, though again criticisms are welcomed_

**3rd Level**

Bonus spells

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the following circle spells whispered to you by the archdruid ghosts of the Circle of Shadows. Once you gain access a circle spell. You always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spelllist, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you,

|Druid Level|Circle Spells|
|---|---|
|3rd|Shadow Blade, Darkness|
|5th|Bestow Curse, Fear|
|7th|Shadow of Moil, Evards Black Tentacles|
|9th|Mislead, Negative Energy Flood|

**6th Level**

Hound of Shadows

Beginning at 6th level you may expend a spell slot of first level or higher to summon a Shadow Mastiff (VGtM p.190) from the Shadows in an unoccupied space within 5ft of you as an action. The Shadow Mastiff is friendly to you and to your allies and acts on your initiative. You may command it telepathically as a bonus action on each of your turns. If you do not command it, the Shadow Mastiff will use its action to attack the nearest creature within sight that is hostile to you, if no hostile creatures are in sight it will instead stay within 10ft of you. The Shadow Mastiff lasts for 5 minutes(?), or until it drops to 0 hitpoints or you dismiss it as a bonus action. Once you have used this ability you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

_This, I feel, is awesome, and comparable in power to the Shadow Sorcerers Hound of Ill Omen whilst remaining different_

**10th level**

Boogieman

At 10th level your ties with the Shadows have grown stronger, enhancing your abilities in the following ways,

- You may Hide as a bonus action on each of your turns.
    
- You become proficient in the Stealth skill if you aren’t already and may add your wisdom modifier to any stealth checks you make in dim light or darkness.
    
- When in darkness or dim light you have resistance to piercing, bludgeoning and slashing damage.
    
- When you use your Shadow Form ability to become a shadow, you gain temporary hitpoints equal to your Druid level + your Wisdom Modifier, in addition that form loses its Sunlight Sensitivity and vulnerability to Radiant Damage.
    

_This is the level where it all comes together, where you truly become the boogie man, I think it accomplishes that without being overly powerful_

---

**14th Level**

Fear the Dark

At 14th level the darkness brings you potency, if you hit a creature with a spell attack whilst either you or your target are in dim light or darkness, that spell deals additional necrotic damage equal to your Wisdom Modifier.

In addition you may force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC. On a failed save they become frightened of you until the end of its next turn. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, regaining all uses after a short or long rest.

_i think this fits the theme, but may be too powerful, please let me know, also tell me if this adds too many rolls_
