Goblin brother of [[Grizz Glastow]]

1. He's constantly scolded by his younger brother who wants to go off and get himself killed. At the end of the day he still loves his brother and wants him to come home safe, but he would never say it outright directly unless it was apparent that his brother was in extreme danger
2. Want's to buy a home in Waterdeep instead of sleeping in shop
3. Jealous of [[Griffin Burnshot]] and [[Kill em Goodes]]
4. ***Origin***:
	1. When he first met [[Boss]] while on patrol with his brother Grizz
	- They were going to bring him to the Goblin Boss, but Boss cast "Friends" on them and convinced them to come with him and he could teach them "BUISNESS" & "ECONOMICS" & how to achieve "BIG GOLD"
		- At the end of the spell Grock realized that something strange had coerced them into agreeing to the idiocy, but instead of turning back to his ways and returning to the Goblin camp he seen that his brother Grizz was fully invested in these ideas, still having know idea a spell was ever used in the first place.
			- Grock grappled with his inner nature and chose his brother over the rest of his people. *He's never spoke this truth to a single soul, although this history explains why he's never been as gung-ho about this new life as Grizz.. but in the end of every internal struggle he can't leave his little brother behind and so he stays and tries to make the best of this life they lead*
