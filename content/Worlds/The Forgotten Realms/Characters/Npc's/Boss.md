Ex-lover and Warlock of [[Amantha Brunswick]]

- Adoptive Wizard Dad of [[Grizz Glastow]] and [[Grock Glastow]]
	- When he first met them he was studying their Goblin camp from afar when the boys stumbled across him while on patrol
	- They were going to bring him to the Goblin Boss, but he cast "Friends" on them and convinced them to come with him and he could teach them "BUISNESS" & "ECONOMICS" & how to achieve "BIG GOLD"
		- At the end of the spell Grock realized that something strange had coerced them into agreeing to the idiocy, but instead of turning back to his ways and returning to the Goblin camp he seen that his brother Grizz was fully invested in these ideas, still having know idea a spell was ever used in the first place.
			- Grock grappled with his inner nature and chose his brother over the rest of his people. *He's never spoke this truth to a single soul, although this history explains why he's never been as gung-ho about this new life as Grizz.. but in the end of every internal struggle he can't leave his little brother behind and so he stays and tries to make the best of this life they lead*
