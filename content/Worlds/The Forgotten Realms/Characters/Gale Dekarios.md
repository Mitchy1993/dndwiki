Gale of [[Worlds/The Forgotten Realms/Locations/Cities-Towns-Region/Waterdeep]], as referred to by some, was a powerful wizard who rose to prominence in the year 1492 DR when he was infected with a special mindflayer tadpole. Gale, [[Tav]] and several other companions worked together to put a stop to a plot, devised by [[Enver Gortash]] to bring about a modified Illithid resurgence; power grab could have possibly stretched as far as total domination of Toril and surrounding planes.

Gale's role in defeating Gortash and the illithid's was paramount as he had the means to stop [[The Absolute]] by means of a netherese orb inside of him that was essentially an atomic bomb of magic.

in the end Gale did not have to resort to destroying himself, as Tav and his companions were able to rally forces to stop Lord Gortash, topple The Absolute and seize control of the [[Crown of Karsus]].

Gale and Tav disappeared shortly after the fall of the The Absolute and have not been seen since that event.
