Ao is the *overgod* in the Dungeons & Dragons multiverse. He is the supreme deity who oversees all other deities and maintains the balance of power between them. Ao is responsible for setting the rules and laws that govern the cosmos, including the behavior of gods and the nature of reality. 

He is not worshiped by mortals and rarely intervenes directly in mortal affairs, preferring to uphold the divine hierarchy and ensure that the gods adhere to their respective domains and responsibilities. 

In essence, ***Ao is the ultimate authority figure in the D&D universe***, ensuring order and balance among the gods and their realms.
