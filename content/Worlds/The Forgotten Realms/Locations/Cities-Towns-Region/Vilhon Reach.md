<small> Lost to the [[Spellplague]] <big>
The **Vilhon Reach** was a region named after a body of water also called the Vilhon Reach, a part of the [Sea of Fallen Stars](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_of_Fallen_Stars "Sea of Fallen Stars").The Reach, as it was commonly called, was site of great empires and great disasters throughout history. The body of water got its current shape from the use of [Elven High Magic](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elven_High_Magic "Elven High Magic") -- which destroyed two empires, [Jhaamdath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Jhaamdath "Jhaamdath") and [Aryselmalyr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Aryselmalyr "Aryselmalyr") -- by summoning an enormous, destructive tsunami that utterly transformed the region. More recently, the region was hit hard by the [Spellplague](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spellplague "Spellplague"), with blue fire roiling through the southern Vilhon and annihilating the remnants of the [Chondathan empire](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chondath "Chondath").
