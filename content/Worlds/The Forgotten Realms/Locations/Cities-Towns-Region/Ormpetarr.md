When the border of the [[Plaguewrought Land]] stabilized in the center of Ormpetarr, the city became a center forÂ [[Scar Pilgrimages]]. 

A significant number of pilgrims who perished in the Vilhon Wilds left behind orphans who roamed Ormpetarr in gangs that labored by day and pickpocketed or thieved by night.

Landmarks:
- [[Foesmasher Keep]], the seat of power in Ormpetarr, located at the center of the eastern edge of the city, surrounded by tall walls.
- Nagapark, a large city park that stood just in front of the [[Foesmasher Keep]] walls.
- The border of the Plaguewrought Land ran through the center of town and appeared as an eye-watering cloud of color. The Plaguewrought Land was healed in the Second Sundering, returning the city to its past size and safety.
- [[Tyrangal]]'s Mansion, a large mansion that belonged to the copper dragon Tyrangal in the years of the Spellplague. The mansion stood alone, surrounded by collapsed buildings, and was heavily warded against intruders.

Inns & Taverns:
- [[Finara's]], a popular 15th century inn that catered to pilgrims and travelers like every other establishment in the city. Finara was the inn's elderly owner, and she offered reasonably-priced accommodations.
- [[Jewel]], a filthy beer and urine-smelling festhall and a brothel that existed in the century between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering. Its most famous employee was Moirah with her spellscar just below the navel.

Temples & Shrines:
- High House of Swords and Banners, colloquially referred to as "the Bloodhall". The biggest temple dedicated to [[Tempus]] that began as a meeting spot for mercenary companies of the Vilhon Reach several centuries before 1370 DR.
- Monastery of [[Kelemvor]], built in 1479 DR on the southern side of town, ministered to pilgrims undertaking their Scar Pilgrimage, most of whom died during the experience.
- Temple of [[Silvanus]], a large temple dedicated to the worship of the Oak Father.
- Temple of [[Tyr]], one of the biggest temples dedicated to Tyr in the Vilhon Reach.
- Ormpetarr had several minor shrines dedicated to [[Eldath]], [[Helm]]
