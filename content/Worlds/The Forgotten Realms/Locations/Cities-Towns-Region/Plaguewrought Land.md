The Plaguewrought Land, south of the [[Vilhon Wilds]] and [[Chondalwood]], once occupied [[Sespech]] and [[Chondath]], covering an area of 400 miles by 200 miles, formerly the [[Golden Plains]]. 

The city of [[Ormpetarr]] was at the northwestern border, split by the plagueland. [[Elbulder]]'s ruins lie to the east, near the [[Chondalwood]].

**Description:**
The Plaguewrought Lands were surreal yet **breathtakingly** grand. The ground heaved like ocean waves, forming [[earthmotes]]. Vegetation was twisted, growing and dying rapidly. Wild magic killed most who ventured in.

**History:**
The border remained stable post-Spellplague. Pilgrims, backed by the [[Order of Blue Flame]], sought [[spellscar]]s.

After the [[Second Sundering]], the Lands vanished, but resurfaced by 1500 DR, nearly restored by 1502.
