The Plaguewrought Land occupied an area south of the [[Vilhon Wilds]] and the [[Chondalwood]] where [[Sespech]] and [[Chondath]] had once stood. It was approximately 400 miles long by 200 miles wide, and covered the area formerly occupied by the [[Golden Plains]]. 

The city of [[Ormpetarr]] was located at the northwestern border and the veil of the plagueland split the old city into two.

The ruins of [[Elbulder]] is to the eastern border of the plague, closest to the [[Chondalwood]] forest
### Description

The Plaguewrought Lands were said to be surreal but **breathtakingly** beautiful and **grand**. Inside this plagueland, the ground heaved like waves on the ocean and pieces of land levitated randomly to form [[earthmotes]]. The vegetation was strange and twisted, and could sprout, mature, and then die in a matter of minutes. Most people who travelled into this region were killed very quickly by the wild magic. Everything within the Plaguewrought Land—be it land, flesh, or the laws of nature—was contorted and changeable.

### History

The border of the Plaguewrought Land remained more or less stable for the decades following the Spellplague. Pilgrims, encouraged by the [[Order of Blue Flame]], often travel to the Plaguewrought Land in the hopes of acquiring a [[spellscar]]

Following the [[Second Sundering]], the Plaguewrought Lands were eliminated. However, in 1500 DR vestiges of the Plaguewrought Land began to resurface and in 1502 they had nearly reacquired their perverted state.
