Shop in [[Waterdeep]] owned by [[Boss]], but run by two progressive Goblins breaking the traditional mold after Boss showed them the value of business and economy

[[Grizz Glastow]] embarks on adventures in order to procure expensive and rare items for the shop giving it a very competitive edge in the city despite the general distaste for Goblins.

[[Grock Glastow]] runs the shop while his younger brother is away
