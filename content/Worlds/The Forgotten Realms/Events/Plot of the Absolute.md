The [[Tav]] and his companions put a stop to [[Enver Gortash]] and his plot to use the [[Crown of Karsus]] to dominate and Elder Brain, and use the Elder Brain as a puppet to enslave the [[Sword Coast]] and possibly the known world.

Ultimately, he was killed and the Tav became a mind flayer himself in order to conquer the Netherbrain, using the Netherstones taken from the [[Crown of Karsus]].
