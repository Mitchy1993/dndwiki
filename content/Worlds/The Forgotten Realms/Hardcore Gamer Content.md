### Summary
- *I am so excited to play with all of you; this is the first game the I've written, so of course, there's excitement with unveiling it.*
- *But what's far more exciting to me is to see how you'll interact with the story/charaters in unexpected ways and how the framework will react to your ideas and choices.*
- *The goal is not to follow a rigid path, but to use this setting to tell **your** stories!*
