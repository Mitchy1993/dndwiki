The Captain [[Timothy Jones]] and First Mate [[Alenia]] command their ship with iron fists. Revered and feared by many, the won't try to touch them. Some have tried to speak out against them but dead men tell no tales.

The Gemfire's favorite port is [[Waterdeep]] where the crew are frequenters of the [[Yawning Portal]]

[[Turak]] is a loyal slave of Alenia on ship, however he was always quite nice to [[Gruumshar]] even though no one else was.
