- When a Chosen is killed, they become a [[Weaveghost]]. Their thoughts and individuality become part of the Weave forever, being able to give advice to other Chosen Ones, dutifully serving Mystra until she sees fit for them to be reborn.Â 
- Chosen Ones are not immortal, they age slowly. They can inhabit any body or corpse and use it as their own or ask Mystra to build them a new one from scratch. In the case of keeping their aging body, they can die and be part of the Weave meanwhile Mystra makes them a new body and puts them in action once more.
- Chosen still have access to Silver Fire
