### General Information:

- **Type:** A conceptual framework for understanding the structure of the Dungeons & Dragons multiverse.
- **Representation:** Depicted as a wheel with various planes arranged in concentric circles.

### Components:

- **[[Prime Material Plane]]:** The mortal world, where most campaign settings, including Faer√ªn and Toril, are located.
- **[[Transitive Planes]]:** The Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane, connecting the Prime Material Plane to other planes.
- **[[Inner Planes]]:** Elemental Planes representing the building blocks of the material world.
- **[[Outer Planes]]:** Divine realms and alignment-based planes inhabited by deities and celestial beings.

### Structure:

- **[[Concentric Rings]]:** The planes are organized in concentric rings around the Prime Material Plane, with the Ethereal and Astral Planes serving as conduits.

### Outer Planes:

- **[[Seven Heavens]]:** Lawful Good-aligned planes.
- **[[Twin Paradises]]:** Neutral Good-aligned planes.
- **[[Elysium]]:** Chaotic Good-aligned planes.
- **[[Happy Hunting Grounds]]:** Neutral planes.
- **[[Twin Paradises]]:** Chaotic Neutral-aligned planes.
- **[[Bleak Eternity of Gehenna]]:** Neutral Evil-aligned planes.
- **[[Nine Hells]]:** Lawful Evil-aligned planes.
- **[[The Abyss]]:** Chaotic Evil-aligned planes.

### Ethereal and Astral Planes:

- **[[Ethereal Plane]]:** Allows travel between planes and is home to ethereal creatures.
- **[[Astral Plane]]:** Connects all planes, facilitating planar travel and serving as a conduit between worlds.

### Key Concepts:

- **[[Portals]]:** Connections between planes, allowing travel between them.
- **[[Sigil]]:** City at the center of the multiverse, a hub for planar travel.
- **Alignment:** The moral and ethical alignment of planes influences the nature of inhabitants and the environment.

### Usage in Campaigns:

- Provides a framework for Dungeon Masters to structure their cosmology and planar adventures.
- Allows for diverse settings and adventures involving interplanar travel and conflicts.

### Associated Modules:

- Many D&D modules and campaign settings use the Great Wheel Cosmology as the basis for their multiverse structure.
