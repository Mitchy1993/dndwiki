A crown created by Karsus himself which granted incredible power to the wearer. It is said that in the right hands it could amplify a mortal to nearly the power of a demi-god.

However, by removing the stones from the crown the wearer could retain it's power but lose it's will to the holder of the stones.

[[Enver Gortash]] devised a plan to dominate an Elder Brain and enslave the world using the crown and stones

After the defeat of Gortash and the Elder brain the crown has not been seen since.
