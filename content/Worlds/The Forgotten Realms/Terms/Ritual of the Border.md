The **Ritual of the Border** was a powerful spell devised by the elven mage [[Vraith]].

The spell could be used to enlarge the size of [[Plaguewrought Land]] or it could be used to encapsulate rogue areas of [[spellplague]]. The ritual required volunteers, who often died horribly during the ritual.
