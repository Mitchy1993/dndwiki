- **Origin of Weave Ghosts:**
  - Manifestation of the soul of a [[Chosen of Mystra]] upon death.
  - Chosen souls seek access to the Weave of Mystra if unable to do so initially.

- **Appearance:**
  - Translucent and ephemeral, with a faint glow resembling shimmering threads of magic.

- **Role in Mystra's Knowledge:**
  - Weave ghosts returning to Mystra are absorbed, granting her the knowledge possessed by her Chosen.

- **Mystra's Intervention:**
  - Mystra can choose to retain the souls of all her Chosen.
  - She can form a new body for them and bring them back to life, subject to limitations imposed by [[Ao]].
  - Mystra typically has an average of 6 Chosen operating simultaneously, historically more than any other deity.
