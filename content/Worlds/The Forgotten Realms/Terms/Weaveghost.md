- **Origin:** A manifestation of the soul of a [[Chosen of Mystra]] when they die
	- A souls of the Chosen do not pass to an afterlife plane, rather they attempt to access the Weave of Mystra, if unable to access the Weave they will forever seek access unless otherwise impeded.
- **Appearance:** Translucent and ephemeral, with a faint glow resembling shimmering threads of magic

Weave ghosts that return to Mystra are absorbed allowing her to gain all of the knowledge her Chosen posessed.
- <small> If [[Mystra]] retains the souls of all her Chosen. If she chooses, Mystra can form a new body for her Chosen and bring them back to life. However, this counts as creating a new Chosen and Mystra can only name a Chosen once in 100 years, up to a maximum decided by [[Ao]]. Mysra has been known to have an average of 6 Chosen operating simultaneously historically, which is significantly more than any other Deity
