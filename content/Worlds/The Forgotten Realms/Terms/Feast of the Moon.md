Feast of the Moon is a significant event celebrated in various cultures throughout the realms, particularly in the Forgotten Realms setting. It is a festival that honors the dead and commemorates ancestors, serving as a time for reflection, remembrance, and sometimes feasting.

The Feast of the Moon typically occurs in autumn, often coinciding with the end of the harvest season. During this time, communities gather to pay homage to their ancestors, gods, and heroes who have passed on. It is a time for storytelling, where tales of valor, sacrifice, and legendary deeds are shared among friends and family.

In some regions, the Feast of the Moon also involves rituals to honor and appease the spirits of the departed, ensuring their continued blessings and protection upon the living. Offerings may be made at gravesites or shrines, and ceremonies are conducted to honor the memory of loved ones.

The festival varies in its specific traditions and customs from one culture to another, but its essence remains consistent across the realms: a time of reverence for the past and a celebration of the bonds that connect the living to their ancestors and to each other.
