Many other different reckoning's exist, but as far as the players are concerned everyone understands Dale's reckoning in much the same way the most countries are familiar with USD.

For ease of play we'll use Jan-Dec for months

### General Information:

- **Dale Reckoning (DR):** A system of dating and time measurement used in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for Dungeons & Dragons.
- **Origin:** The system is based on the founding of the human city of Dale, which marked the beginning of recorded history in the Realms.

### Key Points:

1. **Year 0 DR:**
    
    - The year 0 DR is the year in which the city of Dale was founded.
    - Events before this year are designated as "Before Dale Reckoning" (BDR), and events afterward are designated as "Dale Reckoning" (DR).
2. **Human-Centric:**
    
    - Dale Reckoning is primarily used by humans in the Realms, and it reflects the human perspective on historical events.
3. **Recorded History:**
    
    - The founding of Dale and the adoption of Dale Reckoning marked the beginning of recorded history in the Realms.
    - The system is widely used for documenting events and dating historical records.
4. **Timeline Precision:**
    
    - While the Dale Reckoning system provides a framework for dating events, the precision of historical records may vary, and some periods might have less detailed documentation.
5. **Other Calendars:**
    
    - Different cultures and races in the Forgotten Realms may have their own calendars, and some regions may use alternative dating systems.

### Examples:

- Events in the Realms are often referenced in terms of DR. For example, "The Time of Troubles occurred in 1358 DR" indicates that the event took place 1358 years after the founding of Dale.

### Challenges:

- Interactions with cultures that have different calendars or systems may require translation and coordination of dates.

### Historical Milestones:

- Many significant historical events in the Forgotten Realms are dated using the Dale Reckoning system.
