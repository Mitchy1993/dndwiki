The Weave was considered many things, including [[Mystra]]'s body, the source of magic, all the studies of casters, arcane and divine alike, and the many energies and forces that existed around the planes. Many saw it as a "fabric" on which magic was "drawn", and damaging the fabric caused magic to go awry. Preparing a spell was a means by which a small amount of the Weave could be "contained" and transported for a specific effect, while the casting of a spell was equivalent to telling the Weave to rearrange itself to create the effect.

Importantly, the Weave was not magic itself, but rather a force by which its flows could be channeled, and a means by which magic could be understood and harnessed.  In the years after the [[Spellplague]], the term Weave also became a synonym of the use of magic, although this was not true either. Other systems for calling upon magic had always existed within the Realms, but the Weave was by far the most commonly used, thoroughly refined and best understood.

The Weave was also linked to fate, and a rare few individuals could manipulate such connection to alter the future to their advantage. However, usually the Weave punished those who used "her" in such a way.
