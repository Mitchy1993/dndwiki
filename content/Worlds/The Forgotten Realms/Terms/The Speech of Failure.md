[In a dark, shadowy chamber adorned with flickering candles, Szass Tam, the powerful lich, sits upon his throne, his hollow eyes fixed upon a figure kneeling before him.]

Szass Tam: "My foolish, simple slave, you have failed me once again! Is there no task simple enough to contend with your ineptitude? Your incompetence gnaws at the fabric of even my limitless patience."

[He gestures dismissively, a gesture of disdain evident even in his skeletal form.]

Szass Tam: "However, I am a merciful master, and I shall grant you one final opportunity before I allow you to wither into oblivion, one last chance to prove yourself worthy of the privlieges I've allowed unto you."

[His voice, laced with a blend of malice and cold calculation, echoes through the chamber as he leans forward, his gaze piercing through the darkness.]

Szass Tam: "There is a disturbance in the realm, a call from a mere mortal that reeks of significance. A cleric of Mystra dares to rally adventurers under her banner, promising them a quest of great importance. My informants whisper of threats to our dominion over magic, threats that must be extinguished before they have a chance to take root."

[His bony fingers curl into fists as he speaks, the air around him crackling with dark energy.]
