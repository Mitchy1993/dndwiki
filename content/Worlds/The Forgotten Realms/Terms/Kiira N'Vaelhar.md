1. **Description of the Gem Stone:**
   - The green gem stone holds the knowledge, intellect, and imitation spirit of all former Blackstaffs.
   - It is magically bound to Blackstaff Tower, serving as a repository of the combined wisdom of past Blackstaffs.

2. **Functionality:**
   - Whenever someone becomes a Blackstaff, a template of their spirit, intellect, and knowledge is absorbed into the gem stone and the tower.
   - These absorbed spirits cannot leave the tower but can be communicated with or tapped into for knowledge by the current Blackstaff.
   - This allows successive Blackstaffs to benefit from the collective wisdom and experiences of their predecessors.

3. **Involvement of Krehlan Arunsun:**
   - Krehlan Arunsun, a Blackstaff himself, merged the gem with the tower to serve as the Blackstaff’s advisor.
   - This merger prevented the overwhelming of the current Blackstaff by the combined consciousnesses of previous Blackstaffs.

4. **The Kiira N'Vaelhar:**
   - Originally, the Kiira N'Vaelhar held the spirits and combined knowledge of the first three Blackstaffs: Khelben Arunsun, Tsarra Chaadren, and Kyriani Agrivar.
   - In 1415 DR, Krehlan Arunsun and the Grand Mages of Rhymanthiin dissipated the Kiira and bound its magic to Blackstaff Tower and its twin in Rhymanthiin, N'Vaerymanth.
   - This ensured that the magical essence of the Blackstaffs remained connected to the tower even after the dissolution of the Kiira.
