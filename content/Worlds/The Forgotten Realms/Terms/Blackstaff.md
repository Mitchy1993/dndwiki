**Blackstaff** was the title and name given to the master of the eponymous staff and [[Blackstaff Tower]] including Blackstaff Academy, as well as the [Archmage](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage "Archmage") of [[Worlds/The Forgotten Realms/Locations/Cities-Towns-Region/Waterdeep]] "Blackstaff" was originally a nickname given to [[Khelben Arunsun]] because of his powerful staff of the same name, but after his death it became the title used by his successors.

Over time, rituals and traditions formed, and it became customary for the Blackstaff to choose an heir. The heir served as the apprentice and assistant to the Blackstaff.

The magical quasi-spirits of the former Blackstaffs resided within the tower and served as advisors to the Blackstaff. They were not true spirits but were green-tinged facsimiles produced by the green _[[kiira N'Vaelahr]]. 

The _kiira N'Vaelhar_ once held the spirits and combined knowledge of the first three Blackstaffs, Khelben Arusun, [Tsarra Chaadren](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tsarra_Chaadren "Tsarra Chaadren"), and [Kyriani Agrivar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kyriani_Agrivar "Kyriani Agrivar"), but [Krehlan Arunsun](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Krehlan_Arunsun "Krehlan Arunsun") and the Grand Mages of [Rhymanthiin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rhymanthiin "Rhymanthiin") dissipated the _kiira_ in the Year of Staves Arcane ([1415 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1415_DR "1415 DR")) and bound its magic to Blackstaff Tower and its twin in Rhymanthiin, N'Vaerymanth. 

Now whenever someone became a Blackstaff or the heir, a template of their spirit, intellect, and knowledge became part of the Blackstaff and the tower (not the actual spirits). These spirits could not leave the tower, but the Blackstaff could communicate with them or tap into their knowledge whenever he or she so wished. Krehlan merged the gem with the tower so that it could be the Blackstaff’s advisor, rather than have all the combined consciousnesses of the previous Blackstaffs overwhelm the current Blackstaff.

The Blackstaff could also manipulate the tower at will, opening any door with a thought, and could listen in on the conversations of anyone within the tower. He or she also knew the location and nature of every magical item within the tower and could see the tower’s twin, N'Vaerymanth, in his or her mind.

The seventh Blackstaff was [Vajra Safahr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Vajra_Safahr "Vajra Safahr").
