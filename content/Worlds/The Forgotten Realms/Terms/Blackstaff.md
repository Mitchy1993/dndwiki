The title of "Blackstaff" is bestowed upon the master of the eponymous staff and [[Blackstaff Tower]] in [[Waterdeep]]. Originally a nickname for [[Khelben Arunsun]] due to his powerful staff, it evolved into a title for his successors. Rituals formed, including the selection of an heir who served as apprentice.

The tower housed quasi-spirits of former Blackstaffs, advised by green facsimiles created by [[Kiira N'Vaelahr]]. In 1415 DR, Krehlan Arunsun and Rhymanthiin's Grand Mages dispersed Kiira's magic, binding it to Blackstaff Tower and N'Vaerymanth. Now, spirits of Blackstaffs and heirs reside in the tower, offering wisdom.

Manipulating the tower at will, Blackstaffs could open doors, eavesdrop on conversations, and access the tower's magical inventory. They were also aware of N'Vaerymanth's status. Maliantor's "*[[My Eyes Open Always]]*" notes the Blackstaff's ability to discern the whereabouts and intentions of those within the tower through magical connections.

The seventh Blackstaff was [[Vajra Safahr]].
