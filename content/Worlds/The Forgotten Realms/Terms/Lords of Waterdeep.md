The Lords of Waterdeep are the mysterious and predominantly anonymous ruling council of Waterdeep, having governed the city from the 11th century onwards. They oversee the regional economy, maintain security, performed diplomacy, and hold legal jurisdiction over the city and exert their will over the surrounding lands for approximately 100 mi (160 km) beyond its walls.

This council always had one [[Open Lord]] at all times.
