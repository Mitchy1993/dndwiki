1. **_Dramatic Player Death_**
    1. While making death saving throws, players can still participate on their turn in the following ways:
        
        1. Can take an action but gain _one level of exhaustion_
            
            1. (object interactions, bonus actions, and voluntary ability checks all count as actions in this context.)
            
        
    - Dropping to 0 hit points _automatically_ accrues *one level of exhaustion
    - Talking is free but, short sentences, you are actively bleeding out.
        - The DM will cut you off, ending your turn, if you are abusing this rule.
    - ***Dying condition**: A named character, who has failed their third death save, lingers one minute as if Stunned & Prone, and can only whisper (barely audible if an adjacent listener stands still the whole round and uses their action to listen). Healing effects do not work on Dying creatures. (This minute is the time period where Revivify works.)*  
        _- If a character is Dying while alone, the DM may optionally extend Dying until their final words can be spoken. (At higher levels, Revivify works for another minute of Dying per slot level above 3rd.)_
2.  **Potions** can be an action or bonus action, but your turn ends when you use one
	1. Drinking a potion with an action yields full healing
3. **Critical Criticals**
	1. Critical hits double your damage dice like normal, except the second dice is maximized automatically
4. **More Realistic Combat**
	1. No strategizing during combat
		- Instead, you have 1 minute in between each round to strategize and then the round starts.
		- Once the round has started there will be no strategizing **You are in combat**
		- If someone is outright egregiously breaking this rule, on purpose, their turn will be forfeited
	2. Players can describe their condition, but do not disclose HP
	3. Standing up from prone provokes opportunity attacks from creatures that can reach
1. **Resurrections**
	- A resurrection attempted by spell or effect with longer than a 1 action casting time initiates a "resurrection challenge"
		- Up to 3 members of the party can offer to contribute to the ritual via skill check
			- DM asks each of them to make a skill check based on the form of their contribution
			- DC adjusts based on how helpful/impactful DM feels the contribution would be
	- Successful resurrections, should the soul be willing, will bring player character back to life
	- Failed resurrections, character is lost forever
2. **Sleep Deprivation:**
  - Failure to sleep on a proper surface results in a 10% Max HP penalty (rounded down).
  - Debuff removed by a Long Rest with appropriate accommodations.
3. **Food Deprivation**:
  - Inadequate food leads to a stacking *hungry* debuff:
    - -1 to all ability checks and saving throws.
  - After 3 days, *starving* debuff occurs, reducing Max HP by 20% daily until death.
    - Eating a full meal removes all hunger/starving debuffs.
    - Eating half a meal removes half of all hunger/starving debuffs.
    - Eating a snack prevents a stack for that day.
4. **Opportunity Attacks**
	- Disengage can be taken at the cost of half a creature's move speed unless threatened by two or more enemies
	- If attacking creature has any feats related to opportunity attacks then they negate this method of disengaging.
