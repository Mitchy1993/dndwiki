The [[Order of Blue Flame]], sometimes referred to as the Order of Blue Fire, was an organization whose members often sought out plaguelands in what were referred to as [[Scar Pilgrimages]]. The Order also operated many hospices whose mission was to aid those infected by the Spellplague.

Because of the Order's good works, they were usually welcomed within cities. However, the [[Order of Blue Flame]]'s public face and its true motives were very different. The Order's true belief was that the Spellplague was a holy event and members believed plaguelands should be expanded.

The Order's most active chapter was located in [[Ormpetarr]] and was led by the elven wizard [[Vraith]] until her death.

While some members of the Order were interested in studying the effects of the Spellplague, others such as [[Vraith]] were actually interested in expanding the area of plaguelands.

To accomplish this [[Vraith]] tricked or seduced people into the Ritual of the Border.

The Order sponsored the annual Festival of Blue Fire in [[Ormpetarr]]. Thousands of pilgrims journeyed to [[Ormpetarr]] during the festival in the hope of receiving a spellscar. Unfortunately, most died a horrible death.
