In the Northernmost region of Wildemount, amidst the echoes of forgotten whispers and the weight of centuries-old ruins, a figure emerges from the depths of Aeor's ancient remains. [[Eldrich Veor]], long entombed within the enigmatic ruins, is unearthed by simple tomb raiders and sold to an enigmatic group of enigamtic robed figuers in the heart of the Dwendalian Empire.

Awakening to a world unfamiliar, Eldrich finds himself surrounded by these mysterious cloaked figures, their intentions shrouded in secrecy. With a surge of instinctual energy, he unleashes a divine lightning strike, a remnant of Aeor's lost power, vaporizing the hooded figures in a brilliant flash of light. As the smoke clears, Eldrich finds himself hurled through space and time in the form of a lightening bolt, channeling the remnants of divine energy that once fueled his existence.

Drained and disoriented, Eldrich lands near the edge of a dense jungle, where the rustle of leaves and the call of the wild stir the air. It is here that his path intersects with another, as a young Kobold named Tybalt emerges from the underbrush, his freedom newly found.

[[Tybalt]], a three-year-old adult Kobold, revels in his newfound liberty alongside his faithful Pteranodon companion, Quill. But their celebration is cut short by the blinding radiance of a lightning strike and thunderous roar. From the smoldering crater emerges a figure, collapsing to its knees in exhaustion.

Instinctively, Tybalt and [[Quill]] dart into the safety of the brush, their mouths agape in awe and fear. Minutes pass, tension hanging in the air like a heavy fog, before curiosity outweighs caution, and they cautiously approach the enigmatic figure.

Within arm's reach, Tybalt freezes, his gaze locked on the amulet hanging from the figure's neck, identical to his own. Despite the churning of fear in his gut, Tybalt senses a connection, an inexplicable bond between the two artifacts that defies reason and beckons exploration.

Ignoring Quill's protests, Tybalt's determination prevails as he transforms into a Dimetrodon, dragging the motionless figure to safety. Over the course of a week, Tybalt tends to the stranger's wounds, their fates intertwined by chance and circumstance.

As the embers of the campfire dance in the night sky, the figure stirs, awakening to the world anew. A tentative alliance forms, born of mutual understanding and the shared desire to unravel the mysteries that bind them.

Bound by a common purpose, Eldrich, Tybalt, and Quill set forth on a journey northward, guided by Eldrich's quest to uncover the fate of his homeland. Along the way, Eldrich imparts his knowledge of magic to Tybalt, guiding him in the awakening of his latent abilities and the wielding of newfound powers.

In time, fate intervenes once more as they encounter two other travelersâ€¦
