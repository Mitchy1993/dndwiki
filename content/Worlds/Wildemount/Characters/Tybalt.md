# Theobald 'Tybalt' Scaleheart

- **Race:** Kobold
- **Class:** Barbarian (Level 1), Druid (Circle of the Moon)
- **Background:** Outlander

## Origin Story

Theobald Scaleheart found himself trapped in a perpetual cycle of fear and weakness. In the dense jungle land of Chult his Kobold tribe lived in constant dread; their lives cut short by the ravenous appetite of creatures _stronger_ and more _powerful_.

Inside Tybalt, a seething **rage** and vengeful spirit took root. Determined to break free from the chains of weakness, Tybalt honed his skills as a hunter and scavenger. His prowess was not only a means of survival but a defiant declaration against the predatory forces that sought to keep his kind in perpetual fear.

However, the line between bravery and hubris is fine indeed. One day while venturing far from the safety of his village, the ominous rustle of a **_Sabretooth_** signaled to Tybalt that he had pressed his luck too far that day, the moment he had prepared for had arrived.

But in that defining moment, all his skills, all his bravery, and all his preparation… evaporated.

In a blind fit of terror, he darted away into the brush, cursing himself as he fled. Stumbling along, the floor gave way into a cavern and Tybalt tumbled headlong landing in the depths.

As Tybalt slowly looked up from his prone position, he found himself face-to-face with a long decayed skeletal figure. Adorning that skeleton was an **_amulet_** necklace.

Tybalt, _drawn to the necklace_, reached out… At that exact moment, the Sabretooth lurched at him from above!

However, Tybalt’s contact with the necklace _instantly_ transformed Tybalt into a **Deinonychus**! Whipping around and catching the Tiger by the neck, Tybalt snapped his enemy in the blink of a reptilian eye. Prey had become predator & predator prey; the Sabretooth now limp in Tybalt’s jaws began to glow brilliantly and in a blast of light vanished.

Later that night Tybalt finally arrived home, collapsing into his bedroll. As he lay there the reality of his experience sank in. Something inside Tybalt had changed forever, and it _felt_… good.

    desc: |
      Tybalt can use an action to speak the amulet's command word and throw it on the ground within 10 feet. The amulet becomes a White Sabertooth Tiger under his control, acting on its own initiative. Using a bonus action to speak the command word again, Tybalt can return the amulet to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by the tiger.
      On his turn, Tybalt can mentally command the tiger if it is within 60 feet and he isn't incapacitated. He decides its actions and movement, or issues general commands like attacking enemies or guarding a location. If reduced to 0 hit points, the tiger dies and reverts to amulet form, shattering and being destroyed. If it reverts before losing all hit points, it regains them.
