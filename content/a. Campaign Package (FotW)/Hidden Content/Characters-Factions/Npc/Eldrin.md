<small> Sorcerer of [[The Forgotten]] <big>

Previously a powerful sorcerer, and one of the [[Lords of Waterdeep]]. 

Eldrin willingly studied at [[Blackstaff Tower]] in his despite his innate abilities, Eldrin was fascinated by the [[Weave]] and it's power. He experimented with how it flows through all things and it's ability to connect the world.

Eldrin is not plaguechanged like the rest of [[The Forgotten]],  but actually [[spellscar]]red. His scar allows him to rip portals in the Weave, with great energy cost to himself and teleport nearly anywhere in the material plane so long as he knows where the destination is.

The greater the distance the more it drains him,  *ssssss*

As a servant of Gale, Eldrin is fascinated by the [[Karsite Weave]] and stays on the cutting edge of it's use as an alternative to Mystra's [[Weave]].
