<small> Lieutenant of [[The Forgotten]]<big>

Previously a loyal cleric of Mystra, after the spellplague he mutated into a [[Plaguechanged]] and with little explanation on his condition or why Mystra no longer answered his calls he grew quickly disgruntled. Now a repulsive aberration, his own family was afraid of him and he was ousted by his entire community. 

He blames Mystra for everything, even after discovering the cause of the spellplague he fell strongly that this would have never happened if [[Mystra]] were a more diligent and caring Goddess. 

Arandur is Gale's most loyal servant now, viewing this oppurtunity as the answer to the prayer he  prayed to anyone who would listen for nearly a century. A prayer of revenge.
