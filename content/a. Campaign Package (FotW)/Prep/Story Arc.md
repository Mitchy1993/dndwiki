### Introduction

In the moonlit embrace of the Dalelands, amidst the whispering of ancient trees and the gentle rustle of the wind, a mysterious woman stands alone, her staff clutched tightly in her hands, several broken aberrations strewn about at her feet. Her eyes, once filled with determination, now flicker with uncertainty as she gulps for air, lungs burning.

Mutated figures keep pouring from a dark portal in front of her .... She's reachs out for the Weave one more time... but still it abandons her

A tall dark figure raises a bent finger at her. "Storm Silverhand,"  their voice dripping with venom. "Your time has come."

At that the stillness breaks, two creatures rush her from the sides, suddenly like lightning she cracks her staff into their jaws one after the other and says "why don't you be a gentleman and ask me to dance yourself"

With a defiant cry, Storm charges the figure but several more twisted figures close ranks in front of him as she unleashed a flurry of devastating blows upon her assailants, her strength draining with each passing moment

With a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach, Storm disengaged from the attackers, and grits her teeth. She knows what she has to do...*you guys finish it* 

With a whispered prayer on her lips, she draws forth a hidden dagger from her cloak, its hilt bears the well known symbol of the Goddess [[Mystra]]. 

As she raises it high, the blade glints in the light cast by the whirling portal.

The hooded figure, now suddenly panicked, shouts "NO, stop her, get her, stop her now!"

With one final defiant smirk she shouts "It looks like time is out for both of us", with that she  plunges the dagger into her own heart! With a shrill scream and a burst of blinding light Storm Silverhand's body fades into the ether.

Her light fades and the blackness of the moonless night swallows her departure

A short hooded figure laments into the open air "Gah We're finished, what do we do?"

The tall figure replies after a moment "Until now, we've had the element of surprise, but that is not our greatest advantage... in the end this will make little difference. Back to the portal, we must expedite our plans now"

With that the figures pile back into the portal from whence they came.... 

And now we turn our attention to you players who find yourselves in the bustling Port City of [[Waterdeep]]!

**Friends, Travelers, Intrepid Heroes!** **Introductions are in order!

**Roleplay and explore character stories in the city before meeting at Blackstaff Tower**

[[Sable]], [[Rovair]], [[Gruumshar]], [[Grizz Glastow]], [[Sando Gamgins]]

- Rovair working for Blackstaff to recruit party for Mystra
	- Players are to meet at Blackstaff tower 1 day after arrival for Lord's of Waterdeeps blessing on adventure
	- [[Vajra Safahr]]


### Blackstaff Tower
- Nearby you hear tours being given and a proud Wizard boasts "You know many years ago [[Gale Dekarios]] of Waterdeep, Hero of Baldur's Gate, attended Blackstaff Academy in this very tower! Ah yes a rich history"
- Selene explains that she means to form an expedition into the Plaguewrought lands and investigate the source of these magical disturbances and she needs the help of powerful adventurers
	- For helping me complete my investigation of the [[Plaguewrought Land]] [[Mystra]] will allow each one of you to request a boon from her and she will grant your a desire within her power. (Gold, power, information, etc.)
	- These lands may be a very great threat...
	- **An elderly wizard interjects**: "oh pish posh if you don't hurt the Plaguelands, the Plagueland's won't hurt you, that's what mother always told us kids growing up and mummy was right! You children don't realize, but those lands existed my whole life, it's only been 20 years since they've up and disappeared.
		- With their disappearance magic has gotten far too easy as well. Maybe things will go back to before, it would teach you kiddies discipline!
		- . "Why back in my day magic took gumption, sweat of the brow and vigorous experimentation!
#### [[Eldrin]]s Speech
*A hooded figure matching the nearby statue steps into view*
Adventurers of the Sword Coast, esteemed heroes and brave souls alike, I bid you welcome to this auspicious gathering in front of the famed Blackstaff Tower. As a Lord of Waterdeep, it is my honor and duty to see you off on a journey that holds great significance for the safety and prosperity of our realm.

You have been summoned here today not just by chance, but by the call of destiny itself. Mystra, the goddess of magic, has sensed a disturbance, a plot against her very essence, and it is our collective duty to aid her in uncovering the truth behind this nefarious scheme.

But alas, destiny has a funny way of surprising us. See while I stand before you as a friend and ally, not all attending this event feel the same as.

_His demeanor shifts, his voice taking on a sinister tone._

You all came here with hopes and dreams of greatness and grandeur. But there are those present that would say you are pawns in a game  beyond your understanding. Whether they are right or whether they are wrong is up to you... We shall soon see for Destiny is upon you..

_Within the black shadow of the hood you a bright blue glow pulses where Eldrin's forehead should be. As the pulse glows brighter 
- Grabs Selene and Vajra
	- mages light firebolts but..
	- Nobody moves because hostages
- Mages yell out for city alarm
	- Two mages drop from the roof bleeding/dead
- Vajra: Why... Murderer
- LOW: *regretfully* There was a time when I too would have viewed these deaths as murder, I wish they were not necessary.... one day you will all have perspective as I do. When blood is spilled in devotion to something greater, they do not call it murder, they call it... sacrifice.


_For the first time in Rovair's long life, vajra afraid
thunderclap/lightning through body/40 ft into water._

**Roleplay/non-combat â€¦ otherwise roll initiative*

### [[Plaguewrought Land]]
[[D&D/Campaign 1 (Dom, Ste, Mat, Az, Con)/Player Character's/Rovair]] gets some kind of bonus upon entering

```ad-tip
Really play up the [[Plaguewrought Land]], it is filled with wisps of magic and it's strangely not as dark as you expect. It' almost wonderous in a way, off in the distance you see not one or two but several enormous [[earthmotes]] suspended hundreds and hundreds of feet into the air

<small> Somehow they have their own magical rivers too so water pours from many of them
```
