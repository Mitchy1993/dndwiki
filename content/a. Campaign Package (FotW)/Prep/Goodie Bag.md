### Big Secrets
- [[Chosen of Mystra]] held in [[Elbulder]] at [[Fortress of the Forgotten]]
	- [[Elminster Aumar]] & [[Laeral Silverhand]] have had their spirit's and knowledge copied into the [[Kiira N'Vaelahr]] by the [[Avatar of Gale]]
	- Gale's avatar then absorbed their [[Weave]] and with it their life force, killing them as humanely as possible
		- Gale then trapped their very weak [[Weaveghost]]'s and left them under guard at his first stronghold on Toril, the [[Fortress of the Forgotten]]

- [[Gale Dekarios]] is the [[Weave Eater]], which the [[The Forgotten]] serve.
	- Gale eventually dawns the name [[Karthus]] in honor of [[Karsus]] ,whom he rightly views as having laid the path for his ascension

- [[Purification Society]] is actually a puppet of the [[Red Wizards]]

- [[Rovair]] is actually using [[Karsite Weave]] instead of [[Weave]]

- [[Sando Gamgins]]'s patron is [[Shar]]
	- She has a vested interest because if [[Gale Dekarios]] consumes the weave it will also destroy the [[Shadow Weave]]

- [[Sando Gamgins]] wasn't always short & [[Gruumshar]] wasn't always dumb
	- They had their height and intelligence stolen, respectively by [[Vorenthas]]

- **The Shadow's Call**
	- 
		*When stars align and shadows fall,*
		*The old Weave's thread begins to stall*.
		*In darkness deep, a whisper's thrall,*
		***[[The One in Stone]]**, heeds the call.*
		*--*
		*But heroes rise with hearts of light,*
		*To pierce the gloom, to end the plight.*
		*Seek **[[ancient lore]]**, by **[[moon]]**'s own sight,*
		*And you'll have the **key** to break the night.*
		--
		*If understanding eludes you still,*
		*FInd your answers in **[[Netheril]]***

- [[Amantha Brunswick]] now leads Grizz and Grock's old Goblin tribe
