	- In small area where space is limited this is cute way to move, but like on a board games many times you will pick up your mini to move it to another space or square
	- Turn on movement measuring
- Camera movement
	- Center camera is white dot 
	- Click character tokens to zoom to character
	- Green Cutbox to see in buildings and roofs
- D&D is not a video game it is a theater of the mind, 
		- Easily break the immersion. 
		- Flying your mini around like crazy into areas your character should never ever be able to reach breaks immersion. 
		- The less you break immersion the more fun you can have
	- When flying your mini, holding ctrl allows you to lift it vertically instead of just horizontally
	- Shift click for teleport (If it doesn't work might be DM only)
	- Toggle on movement measuring
	- If you ever get lost or need to be brought to the party, let me know I can teleport you all into a group at the same location if needed.
- Combat 
	- Attacking animations
	- Loading Stats onto character. *(Speeds up combat)*

```ad-hint
I need your spell lists, fight club 5e will do it for you with character sheet

Remind follow up with anyone who still needs feat, asi, or magic item

Any time you get items write them down in your notes or in fight club 5e. I might not, so if I don't have it and you don't have it that item is just lost.. *cuz nobody knows what it was*
```

```ad-tip
Personal reminder - Put out spell cards for player charcters to answer their questions in game
```
