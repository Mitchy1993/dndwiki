## Spellcasting Services

People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. 
  
Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as _[cure wounds](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:cure%20wounds?expansion=0#content)_ or _[identify](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:identify?expansion=0#content)_, is **easy** enough in a city or town, and might cost **10 to 50 gold pieces** (*plus the cost of any expensive material components*). 

Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a **service instead of payment**—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.
